# PO\_SolveAdjacency

Use this command to split and match walls between rooms. If non-room geometries are selected, this command only does split for each subsurface. Apertures and doors will be adjusted to match new walls. The boundary condition of the aperture or door won't be changed if its outdoor walls become indoor surface,
