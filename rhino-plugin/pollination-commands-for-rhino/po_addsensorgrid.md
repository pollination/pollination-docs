# PO_AddSensorGrid

![](./img/PO_AddSensorGrid.gif)

Adding sensor grids for running Radiance grid based simulations.
The input geometries can be Rhino surfaces, rooms or orphaned faces. 
For rooms, only sub-surfaces with floor type will be used for generating sensor grids.

## Options

* **GridSize**

  space between any two sensor points. (in Rhino&apos;s unit)

* **Offset**

  offset distance from the input geometries. (in Rhino&apos;s unit)
