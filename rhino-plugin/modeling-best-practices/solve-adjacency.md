# Solve Adjacency

Solve adjacency (command: [PO\_SolveAdjacency](../pollination-commands/po\_solveadjacency.md)) is used for setting up interior surfaces. Users can select a partial of rooms or entire model for solving adjacencies. The existing interior surface will not be changed to outdoor boundary condition, and it will be updated when a new adjacent surface is found.

Users can also have an option to reset all surface's boundary conditions by using command [PO\_ResetBoundaryCondition](../pollination-commands/po\_resetboundarycondition.md), which will reset all interior surface to outdoor or ground condition.
