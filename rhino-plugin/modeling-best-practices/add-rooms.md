# Create Rooms

## What are Rooms and Why Do You Need Them?

Pollination uses a room-based modeling hierarchy which allows for surface-based modifications. The room-by-room approach is efficient for creating a quick analytical model to simulate energy, daylight, or comfort performance without spending time with a surface-by-surface.

There are three methods for creating rooms using Pollination:&#x20;

1. Select Geometries
2. Select by Layers
3. Draw New Room

{% hint style="info" %}
A room-based model is not required for daylight simulations, users can still use surface-by-surface method to build a daylight model. It is worth noting that a non-room-based model is not simulate-able for EnergyPlus simulations.

Because Rhino offers unparalleled modeling flexibility, there are several ways that you can draw Pollination rooms from scratch. In this video, we review three of the most common ways to draw rooms.

1. Import a Plan and Trace
2. Align to Grid
3. Draw a Mass and Split Rooms&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
All rooms should be modeled as a closed planar polysurface. If they are not, then you will see an error indicating that your polysurface is open.
