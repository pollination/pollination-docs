# Create Apertures

An aperture is an opening, hole, or gap within a room. Apertures should always be modeled as planar surfaces that are coplanar with the appropriate face of your room. If you have floor-to-ceiling windows on a face of a room, then the window edge should not overlap with any room face edge.

Similar to rooms, there are three ways to add or draw apertures:&#x20;

1. Select Geometries
2. Add by Window to Wall Ratio
3. Draw an Aperture&#x20;
