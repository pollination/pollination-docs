# Model Validation

The validation process happens automatically upon import of a model to the Rhino
plugin or whenever the [PO_ValidateModel](./pollination-commands/po_validatemodel)
command is run. It can also be run on a `.hbjson` file from command line by installing
[lbt-honeybee](https://pypi.org/project/lbt-honeybee/) and then running the
[`honeybee validate model`](https://www.ladybug.tools/honeybee-core/docs/cli/validate.html)
command.

The validation process runs a number of tests on the model, each of which correspond
to a specific validation error code. A model failing a specific test will return this
error code along with a message about the failing Model object. A model that passes
all validation can usually be simulated in any of the engines that Honeybee connects
to without error.

Invalid models may still be simulate-able in some engines but not others. For this reason,
it is helpful to check the consequences of each error code since it can sometimes be ok
to ignore them. Furthermore, the event that an error must be fixed, it is important to
know how to fix it and errors sharing the same error code can usually be fixed with
similar methods.

**Note**: While a valid model can be simulated in any simulation engine, it is always
the responsibility of the modeler to ensure that the assumptions of the valid model
align with the real building design that they are informing.

## Validation Error Codes

Below is a list of all validation error codes that can be obtained from the Honeybee
Model validation process. Each one is described in detail and many include suggestions
for how to fix them.

## Core Error Codes

### 000000

**Unknown Error** - A blank error code reserved for cases where the specific origin
of the error is unknown. This error code should not appear in "normal" usage of the
validation process and is typically an artifact of new honeybee extensions that are
just starting to add their own validators.

### 000001

**Duplicate Shade Identifier** - Two or more Shades in the model have the same identifier.
This is not only illegal in EnergyPlus and can cause strange behavior in Radiance but
it can also result in errors during serialization of the model to/from any file format.
For example, properties for EnergyPlus or Radiance may be assigned to the incorrect object.

This issue should be fixed by finding the object with the duplicate identifier and changing its
ID or deleting the object. In Rhino, the [PO_ResetIdentifier](./pollination-commands/po_resetidentifier)
command can be used change object identifiers.

### 000002

**Duplicate Sub-Face Identifier** - Two or more Apertures or Doors in the model have
the same identifier. This is not only illegal in EnergyPlus and can cause strange
behavior in Radiance but it can also result in errors during serialization of the
model to/from any file format. For example, properties for EnergyPlus or Radiance
may be assigned to the incorrect object.

This issue should be fixed by finding the object with the duplicate identifier and changing its
ID or deleting the object. In Rhino, the [PO_ResetIdentifier](./pollination-commands/po_resetidentifier)
command can be used change object identifiers.

### 000003

**Duplicate Face Identifier** - Two or more Faces in the model have the same identifier.
This is not only illegal in EnergyPlus and can cause strange behavior in Radiance but
it can also result in errors during serialization of the model to/from any file format.
For example, properties for EnergyPlus or Radiance may be assigned to the incorrect object.

This issue should be fixed by finding the object with the duplicate identifier and changing its
ID or deleting the object. In Rhino, the [PO_ResetIdentifier](./pollination-commands/po_resetidentifier)
command can be used change object identifiers.

### 000004

**Duplicate Room Identifier** - Two or more Rooms in the model have the same identifier.
This is not only illegal in EnergyPlus and can cause strange behavior in Radiance but
it can also result in errors during serialization of the model to/from any file format.
For example, properties for EnergyPlus or Radiance may be assigned to the incorrect object.

This issue should be fixed by finding the object with the duplicate identifier and changing its
ID or deleting the object. In Rhino, the [PO_ResetIdentifier](./pollination-commands/po_resetidentifier)
command can be used change object identifiers.

### 000101

**Non-Planar Geometry** - Not all of the vertices of a given geometry object (Face,
Aperture, Door, Shade) lie within the same plane. In order to fail this test, a
vertex must be further from the plane by the Model's tolerance.

This error must be fixed for simulation in both Radiance and EnergyPlus since these
engines only accept planar geometry.

If the non-planarity of the geometry is not that severe, it can sometimes be fixed
by using the [PO_AlignToGrid](./pollination-commands/po_aligntogrid) command.
Otherwise, a more detailed editing of vertices on the individual geometry object
may be required.

### 000102

**Self-Intersecting Geometry** - The edges of a geometry object (Face, Aperture,
Door, Shade) intersect one another (like a bowtie shape). This can cause issues
when performing shading calculations in both Radiance and EnergyPlus.

Note that duplicated vertices are still considered valid in Honeybee model
geometry and vertices are considered duplicated if they are clos to each other
within the Model tolerance. So this error will typically only arise when the
edges of the object noticeably intersect one another.

Typically, the geometry must be redrawn in order to fix it, though it is sometimes
possible to fix it simply by rearranging vertices.

### 000103

**Zero-Area Geometry** - The area of the geometry is smaller than the model tolerance.
These geometries do not affect Radiance simulation and are automatically removed
upon export to EnergyPlus so there is usually no requirement to fix them. However,
it is often nice to do so in order to clean up the model.

The typical way to address these zero-area geometries is to simply delete them.

### 000104

**Invalid Sub-Face Geometry** - An Aperture or a Door is not co-planar with its
parent Face or does not lie completely inside the parent Face boundary. Fixing this
is a requirement for both EnergyPlus and Radiance. In EnergyPlus, this error can
result in incorrect estimation of solar gains if an Aperture is significantly
larger than its parent Face or is facing the incorrect direction. In Radiance,
the parent Face will not have the child geometries properly "punched" out of it,
often resulting is odd visuals.

Note that this error will still arise even when the child Aperture or Door is only sharing
an edge with the parent Face, which is technically still acceptable for certain Energy
simulations but will often cause issues in Radiance and will results in display
issues for most model viewers.

The best way to address the issue is to zoom into the geometry and move or scale the
incorrect sub-face until it is valid. Completely removing the sub-face and redrawing
it is also an option when many of these errors arise at once.

### 000105

**Overlapping Sub-Face Geometry** - The Apertures and/or Doors of a Face overlap with one
another such that the sum of their areas is greater than the parent Face. Fixing this
is a requirement for both EnergyPlus and Radiance. In EnergyPlus, this error can
result in over-estimation of solar gains as multiple overlapping Apertures each
contribute solar energy to the parent Room. In Radiance, the parent Face will
not have the child geometries properly "punched" out of it, often resulting in parts
of the Aperture that overlap with others becoming opaque.

The best way to address the issue is to zoom into the geometry and delete any sub-faces
that are known to be incorrect or duplicated.

### 000106

**Non-Solid Room Geometry** - There is a Room in the model that is not a closed solid
to within the model tolerance. Closed Room solids are required for EnergyPlus simulation
since the volume of air in the Room cannot be calculated if the Room does not form
a closed solid. Furthermore, the orientation of Walls, Roofs, Floors and Apertures
in relation to the inside/outside of the Room volume cannot be verified when the
Room is not solid, which is required for correct solar calculations.

While a Radiance simulation with non-closed Room solids can technically succeed, there
will usually be light leaks into the Room if it is not a closed solid, resulting in
potentially inaccurate radiance/luminance values. Furthermore, some modifiers that
behave differently depending on the orientation of the geometry they are applied
to may be assigned incorrectly given that the relation of the Walls, Roofs, Floors,
and Apertures to the inside/outside of the Room volume cannot be verified. This is
particularly dangerous with BSDF modifiers and 3 or 5 phase simulations.

There are two ways that a Room is not recognize as a solid:

1. Naked Edges - The Room volume is open resulting in edges that belong to only one Face.
This case should be fixed by patching the hole with a new Face geometry or moving the
geometries around the hole to close it up.

2. Non-manifold Edges - The Room has an edge that is shared by three or more Faces.
This often means that there is a Face extending inward or outward from the Room volume,
thereby interfering with the Room's volumetric calculations. Non-manifold edges
can also result from tiny "sliver Faces" that are smaller than the Model
tolerance and therefore collapse into an single edge shared by multiple Faces.
Non-manifold edges should typically be fixed by deleting the sliver Face or the Face
extending inward/outward from the Room volume.

The message associated with the error should list the number of naked and
non-manifold edges contained in the Room geometry.

### 000201

**Self-Referential Adjacency** - The model contains a Face, Aperture or Door with a
Surface boundary condition that references itself. This is illegal for EnergyPlus
simulation, though it may have little to no effect on Radiance simulation if the
geometry is clean.

It should be fixed by either re-solving adjacency or, if the Face, Aperture or Door
has no adjacent geometry object in the model, the boundary condition could be changed to
be Adiabatic or Outdoors.

### 000202

**Intra-Room Adjacency** - The model contains a Room with two Faces that are adjacent
to each other and reference each other in their Surface boundary conditions. This
cannot be possible if the Room is a closed solid and this particular type of error
may sometimes be accompanied by a "Non-Solid Room Geometry" error (often with
non-manifold edges). This condition is illegal for EnergyPlus simulation, though
it may have little to no effect on Radiance simulation if the geometry is clean.

It should be fixed by either deleting the self-referencing Faces or (if the parent
Room is solid) by re-solving adjacency.

### 000203

**Object with Multiple Adjacencies** - The model contains Faces, Apertures or Doors with
Surface boundary conditions that indicate multiple objects are adjacent to a single
Face, Aperture or Door object. This is illegal for EnergyPlus simulation, though
it may have little to no effect on Radiance simulation if the geometry is clean.

It should usually be fixed by deleting one of the objects that is among the "multiple
adjacent objects." Alternatively, if the geometry is clean, it might also be fixed
by re-solving adjacency.

### 000204

**Missing Adjacency** - The model contains a Face, Aperture or Door with a Surface
boundary condition referencing another object that is not in the model. This can often
happen if a previously existing Room has been deleted from the model or some change has
been made to reset identifiers or boundary conditions in the model. It is illegal for
EnergyPlus simulation and will usually result in duplicated interior geometries
in Radiance simulations, which may succeed but have patchy or incorrect modifiers.

It can usually be fixed by re-solving adjacency.

### 000205

**Mismatched Area Adjacency** - The model contains an adjacent pair of Faces, Apertures
or Doors that are otherwise valid but do not have equivalent areas to each other within
the model tolerance. Matching areas are required for EnergyPlus simulation in order
to ensure there is matching heat flow across adjacent Faces. Otherwise, conservation
of energy is usually violated and EnergyPlus will give a severe error. This condition
may have little to no effect on Radiance simulation if the geometry is otherwise "clean."

This error can usually be fixed by re-solving adjacencies with the intersection
step selected in order to ensure any mismatched geometries are correctly split
with their neighboring geometry.

### 000206

**Non-Adjacent AirBoundary** - The model contains an AirBoundary Face that does not have
a Surface boundary condition and is not adjacent to another Room in the Model. All
AirBoundary Faces must be adjacent to another Room for EnergyPlus simulation since
EnergyPlus expects to simulate detailed radiant heat and air exchange between Rooms
across an AirBoundary. In Radiance simulation, this a non-adjacent AirBoundary
is permissible, though it's effectively equivalent to having a Room geometry
open to the outdoors.

The error might be fixed by re-solving adjacency or, if the erroneous AirBoundary
Face is not between two Rooms, then it should be changed to a different face
type like a Wall, Roof, or Floor.

### 000207

**Room Composed Entirely of AirBoundaries** - The model contains a Room composed entirely
of AirBoundary Faces. This condition is currently illegal in EnergyPlus since
EnergyPlus is not equipped to model Rooms that contain no "real" geometry (Walls,
Roofs, and Floors). This may change in the future depending on the outcome of
[this issue](https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/issues/9335)
and this condition is currently completely valid for Radiance simulation.

It should be fixed by merging the Room composed entirely of AirBoundaries into a
neighboring Room that contains "real" geometry (Walls, Roofs, and Floors).


## Radiance Error Codes

### 010001

**Duplicate Modifier Identifier** - Two or more Modifiers in the model have the same identifier.
While Radiance will often let the simulation proceed with this situation, it can result in
confusing results since Radiance will always use the first occurrence of the modifier that
is found in the input files. This situation can also result in issues during serialization
of the model to/from any file format. For example, a geometry object may be assigned
the incorrect modifier between the two duplicate identifiers.

This issue should be fixed by finding the object with the duplicate identifier and
changing its identifier.

### 010002

**Duplicate ModifierSet Identifier** - Two or more ModifierSets in the model have the
same identifier. This situation can result in issues during serialization of the model
to/from any file format. For example, a Room object may be assigned the incorrect
ModifierSet between the two duplicate identifiers.

This issue should be fixed by finding the object with the duplicate identifier and
changing its identifier.

### 010003

**Duplicate SensorGrid Identifier** - Two or more SensorGrids in the model have the
same identifier. While this situation is typically safe for serializing the model to/from
file formats, it will result in one sensor grid result overwriting another in any
Radiance simulation of the model.

This issue should be fixed by finding the object with the duplicate identifier and
changing its identifier.

### 010004

**Duplicate View Identifier** - Two or more Views in the model have the same identifier.
While this situation is typically safe for serializing the model to/from file formats,
it will result in one view overwriting another in any Radiance simulation of the model.

This issue should be fixed by finding the object with the duplicate identifier and
changing its identifier.

### 010005

**SensorGrid Room Not In Model** - The model contains a SensorGrid that references a Room
that is not in the Model (via the SensorGrid's room_identifier property). This can often
happen if a previously existing Room has been deleted from the model or some change has
been made to reset identifiers of Rooms in the model. This situation may nt need to be 
fixed for many simple types of Radiance simulations but will cause issues in more
complex 3 or 5 phase simulations, which rely on the Room reference to determine the
light sources.

This issue should be fixed by finding the SensorGrid and either removing its room_identifier
or changing it to match the Room that it is actually assigned to.

### 010006

**View Room Not In Model** - The model contains a View that references a Room
that is not in the Model (via the View's room_identifier property). This can often
happen if a previously existing Room has been deleted from the model or some change has
been made to reset identifiers of Rooms in the model. This situation may nt need to be 
fixed for many simple types of Radiance simulations but will cause issues in more
complex 3 or 5 phase simulations, which rely on the Room reference to determine the
light sources.

This issue should be fixed by finding the View and either removing its room_identifier
or changing it to match the Room that it is actually assigned to.


## Energy Error Codes

### 020001

**Duplicate Material Identifier** - Two or more Material layers in the model have the
same identifier. This is illegal in EnergyPlus and it can also result in issues
during serialization of the model to/from any file format. For example, a construction
may be assigned the incorrect material layer between the two duplicate identifiers.

This issue should be fixed by finding the object with the duplicate identifier and
changing its identifier.

### 020002

**Duplicate Construction Identifier** - Two or more Constructions in the model have the
same identifier. This is illegal in EnergyPlus and it can also result in issues
during serialization of the model to/from any file format. For example, a Face or Aperture
may be assigned the incorrect construction between the two duplicate identifiers.

This issue should be fixed by finding the object with the duplicate identifier and
changing its identifier.

### 020003

**Duplicate ConstructionSet Identifier** - Two or more ConstructionSets in the model
have the same identifier. This can result in issues during serialization of the model
to/from any file format. For example, a Room may be assigned the incorrect construction
set between the two duplicate identifiers.

This issue should be fixed by finding the object with the duplicate identifier and
changing its identifier.

### 020004

**Duplicate ScheduleTypeLimit Identifier** - Two or more ScheduleTypeLimits in the model
have the same identifier. This is illegal in EnergyPlus and can result in issues during
serialization of the model to/from any file format. For example, a Schedule may be
assigned the incorrect schedule type limit between the two duplicate identifiers.

This issue should be fixed by finding the object with the duplicate identifier and
changing its identifier.

### 020005

**Duplicate Schedule Identifier** - Two or more Schedules in the model have the same
identifier. This is illegal in EnergyPlus and can result in issues during serialization
of the model to/from any file format. For example, a ProgramType may be assigned the
incorrect schedule between the two duplicate identifiers.

This issue should be fixed by finding the object with the duplicate identifier and
changing its identifier.

### 020006

**Duplicate ProgramType Identifier** - Two or more ProgramTypes in the model have
the same identifier. This can result in issues during serialization of the model
to/from any file format. For example, a Room may be assigned the incorrect program
type between the two duplicate identifiers.

This issue should be fixed by finding the object with the duplicate identifier and
changing its identifier.

### 020007

**Duplicate HVAC Identifier** - Two or more Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning
(HVAC) systems in the model have the same identifier. This can result in issues during
serialization of the model to/from any file format. For example, a Room may be assigned
the incorrect HVAC system between the  two duplicate identifiers.

This issue should be fixed by finding the object with the duplicate identifier and
changing its identifier.

### 020008

**Duplicate SHW Identifier** - Two or more Service Hot Water (SHW) systems in the
model have the same identifier. This can result in issues during serialization of
the model to/from any file format. For example, a Room may be assigned the
incorrect SHW system between the  two duplicate identifiers.

This issue should be fixed by finding the object with the duplicate identifier and
changing its identifier.

### 020201

**Mismatched Adjacent Constructions** - Two adjacent Faces, Apertures or Doors do not
have constructions with material layers that are in reversed order from each other,
thereby making the order of material layers for the interior Wall, Floor or Window
ambiguous. This is illegal in EnergyPlus and typically results from applying the
same asymmetric construction to an adjacent Face or Aperture pair. It can also happen
if two adjacent geometry objects have completely different constructions from one another.

The simplest way to fix the issue is to re-assign a symmetric construction to both
adjacent objects. Symmetric constructions are ones where the reversed order of materials
is the same as the non-reversed order. The issue can also be solved by taking an
existing asymmetric construction, duplicating it, reversing its material order,
giving it a new name/identifier, and assigning it to the other adjacent object.
