# Rhino Import/Export

Pollination Rhino allows for the export of geometry and properties in the gbXML, OSM, IDF, hbjson file format.

There is no loss of information when exporting to HBJSON and all energy properties are
included upon export to OSM and IDF. For gbXML, the properties that are exported
are the same as those which are imported.

* [Export Honeybee JSON \(HBJSON\)](hbjson.md)
* [Export Green Building XML \(gbXML\)](gbxml.md)
* [Export OpenStudio Model \(OSM\) + Input Data File \(IDF\)](osm.md)
