# Assign Modifier Sets

Materials that we use for any Radiance related simulations is called **Modifier**. We have also added a new concept **Modifier Set** for a group of modifiers. Modifier set is useful in cases when users want to have a global control of all modifiers that apply to the entire project, and easier for reporting a modifier summary.
