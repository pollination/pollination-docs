# PO_ProjectChildToHost

Check all child objects (apertures and doors) of selected rooms to ensure they are coplanar with their host faces. 

Notes:
- This command will automatically project the child geometry to its host&apos;s plane.
- It is important apertures and doors are coplanar to get a valid energy and radiance model.
