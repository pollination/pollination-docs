# PO_SetAirBoundariesByGuides

Use this command to set rooms&apos; interior surface to air boundary type based on guide surfaces.

Notes:
- Guide surfaces have to be coplanar to target interior surfaces and fully cover the interior surface geometries.
- It requires adjacencies to be already solved before using. So run PO_SolveAdjacency first before using this command.
