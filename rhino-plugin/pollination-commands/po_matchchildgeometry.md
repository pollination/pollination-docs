# PO_MatchChildGeometry

This command updates the source geometry from the guide geometry while keeping all other properties.

Notes:
- It changes the aperture or door dimensions of the first selection.
- It does not change the energy and radiance properties of the first selection but just the dimensions and the location of the geometry part.
- The first selection will have the same aperture/door dimensions of the second selection.
