# PO_AddSiteContext

Add selected geometries as site contexts to model. This can be used to add trees, surrounding buildings, or site structures that are not directly attached to the building. Use &quot;Pollination&quot; command to open Orphaned Object Manager to check and edit each shade object.

Notes:
- The selection can be a brep or a series of surfaces.
- If the selection contains a brep with curved brep faces they will be planarized automatically.
