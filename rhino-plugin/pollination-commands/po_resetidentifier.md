# PO_ResetIdentifier

Reset a honeybee object&apos;s identifier and boundary condition. You can also select partial room&apos;s sub-faces for resetting boundary condition.
All geometries&apos; boundary condition will be reset to Outdoor, unless geometry touches the ground (0) and then it will be set to Ground.
