# PO\_AddSensorGrid

![](../../.gitbook/assets/PO_AddSensorGrid.gif)

Adding sensor grids for running Radiance grid based simulations. The input geometries can be Rhino surfaces, rooms or orphaned faces. For rooms, only sub-surfaces with floor type will be used for generating sensor grids.

## Options

* **GridSize**

  space between any two sensor points. \(in Rhino's unit\)

* **Offset**

  offset distance from the input geometries. \(in Rhino's unit\)
