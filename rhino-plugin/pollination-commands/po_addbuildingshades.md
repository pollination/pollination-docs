# PO_AddBuildingShades

Add selected shade surfaces to model. Use &quot;Pollination&quot; command to open Orphaned Object Manager to check and edit each shade.

Notes:
- The selection can be a brep or a series of planar surfaces.
- If the selection contains a brep with curved brep faces they will be planarized automatically.
