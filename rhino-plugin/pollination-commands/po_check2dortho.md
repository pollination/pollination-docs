# PO_Check2DOrtho

Analysis 2D plans (curves) and visualize non-orthogonal geometries based on a reference plane.

## Options

* **Custom Plane**

  Set a custom plane by two points (X axis). Default is a World XY plane.

* **Angle Tolerance**

  A degree number from 0 to 360 used for non-orthogonal checks. A perfect orthogonal geometry means 90 degree from a base axis when angle tolerance is set to 0. Increase the angle tolerance would consider lines orthogonal within a range of 90 +- the angle tolerance. Default 0.01.

Notes:

* **The results are non-orthogonal lines. 
**
