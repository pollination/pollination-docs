### 3. Follow the steps to input your information and make the purchase.

We use [Paddle](https://paddle.com/) to process the payments. Once you make the payment you will receive an email from them with a link to the invoice.

**You can add your Coupon to your payment at the same step that you input the card data.**

Once the payment is confirmed you will receive a notification email from Paddle (not Ladybug Tools or Pollination) in your inbox.

**Manage floating licenses**

All the Pollination Rhino licenses are floating licenses. That means that you can share them with other users on Pollination.

1. Click on the `Manage Floating Licenses` button under the subscription tab.

There are two other tabs under the *Rhino Plugin Subscription* panel.

**Manage tab**

You can use the *manage* tab to manage your subscription. In particular, you can:

1. Add more licenses to your current subscription. _Note that updating the subscription will remove all your current coupons._
2. Cancel your subscription. _Note that we have a no refund policy. If you want to cancel your subscription for the next upcoming payment you should cancel it right before the new payment kicks in._
3. Update your payment method

The *payments* tab shows all your previous and upcoming payments. You can use the link under the Receipt column to get the receipt for each payment.
