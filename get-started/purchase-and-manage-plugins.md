# Purchase and Manage Plugins

Pollination plugins are required if you would like to use Pollination from within your CAD/BIM software. If you plan to use Pollination across more than one software package, you will need to purchase and download multiple installation files. For plugin pricing, please visit our [pricing page](https://www.pollination.cloud/pricing-cad-plugins). &#x20;


{% hint style="info" %}
For sharing the CAD licenses among several Pollination users you must buy the licenses under an organization account. A license that is purchased under a personal account can only be used by the account owner.

### Step 1

Click on your avatar and select _Subscription_ to bring up your subscription management page or click on the blue _Buy Licenses_ button to bring up the purchasing page.&#x20;

If you are buying plugins for multiple CAD software, you'll have to repeat Steps 2 and 3 for each plugin at this time. &#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
NOTE: We use [Paddle](https://paddle.com/) to process all payments on our platform. Once you complete payment, you will receive an email from Ladybug Tools (via Paddle.com) with a link to your invoice/receipt. Please check your spam and junk folders after making your payment if you don't see an email confirmation in your inbox.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Step 4

Congratulations! Once payment is processed you should see the license under your account. If the screen doesn't automatically update, hit the refresh button on your screen to access _Management_ and _Payment_ tabs for your subscriptions.&#x20;

#### Manage Tab

Under _Manage_, you can increase/decrease the number of licenses you own, cancel your subscription, and update payment methods.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please review our cancellation policy in our [Terms of Service](https://www.pollination.cloud/terms-of-service) as we are unable to provide prorated refunds for subscription changes that occur earlier than the renewal date. All changes are effective immediately, so if you cancel or update the number of licenses you have, please do so as close to your renewal date as possible.&#x20;

Updating the number of licenses also removes any coupons that might be applied to your original subscription.    &#x20;
