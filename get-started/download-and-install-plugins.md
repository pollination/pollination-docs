# Plugin Installation

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Rhino" %}
{% hint style="info" %}
The Pollination Rhino plugin is designed for optimal compatibility with Rhino 7. If you are using Rhino 6, there is an incompatibility issue with the way Rhino 6 loads plugins. After installing Pollination, you will need to open and close Rhino **three times** to load the Pollination plugin.
{% endhint %}


### Step 1

{% hint style="warning" %}
Rhino must be closed before running the installer to install or uninstall Pollination.
{% endhint %}
