# Create an Organization

An organization account is the only account type that supports multiple users and the ability to create teams. An organization can be a company, an association, a joint venture, or any other entity.

### Enter Organization Details

Type in the account email address, display name, and a unique name for your account. As the name implies, Pollination supports duplicate display names, but unique names must be - unique! If the name you chose is already taken, the entry field will alert you to choose a different name. You can either enter the URL of an image you would like to user as an avatar, or upload your own image after creating your organization. Click on _Create Organization_ to continue.

{% hint style="info" %}
You have now created a free tier organization. This organization cannot have additional members, and has no cloud resources. You can use this organization to manage license pools for Pollination CAD Plugins.
