# Manage License Pool

Since all Pollination CAD licenses are floating licenses, multiple users can share a license to use at different times. The original purchaser, or administrator, of a CAD license, can immediately access Pollination from within their chosen CAD interface. To share access within an organization the administrator must add members to their organization and then the License Pool.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
For sharing the licenses using a license pool you must buy the licenses under an organization account. A license that is purchased under a personal account can only be used by the account owner.
{% endhint %}
