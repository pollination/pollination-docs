# 5. Manage License Pools

{% hint style="warning" %}
This section is only applicable to licenses that are purchased under an organization account. A license that is purchased under a personal account can only be used by the account owner.
{% endhint %}

Since all Pollination CAD licenses for an Organization are floating licenses, multiple organization members can share a license to use at different times. The owners of the organization can immediately access Pollination from within their chosen CAD interface. To share access within an organization the owner must add members to their organization and then the License Pool.
