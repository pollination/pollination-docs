# Create a Pollination Account

You'll need a Pollination account to access all features of the Pollination ecosystem. This includes joining an organization, downloading plugins, using cloud simulation resources, and participating in the forum. Luckily, you can join for **free**! The Starter account gives you a limited amount of cloud computing resources and access to the Pollination ecosystem. To get the most out of Pollination, consider creating an **Organization** account and add additional seats or computing packages.
