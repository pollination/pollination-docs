# 6. Add Additional Computing Resources

An organization includes an unlimited number of projects, recipes, and teams but it doesn't include any computing resources by default. To run simulations under an organization account, you need to buy additional computing resources for your organization.

{% hint style="info" %}
The computing resources will be shared among all the organization's projects and members.
{% endhint %}

Pollination provides several options based on your needs. You can either select a monthly or an annual billing period.

{% hint style="info" %}
The annual billing offers a free month of subscription.

{% hint style="warning" %}
We use Paddle for processing the payments. As a result, it might take a few seconds before the subscription shows up under your account. If you don't see the subscription under your account immediately, try to refresh the page and the card should be updated.
