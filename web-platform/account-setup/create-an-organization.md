# 1. Create an Organization

An organization account is the only account type that supports multiple users and the ability to create teams. An organization can be a company, an association, a joint venture, or any other entity.

{% hint style="info" %}
You must have a free Starter account first before you can create an Organization.

## Step 1

Click on your avatar and select _Create an Organization_ to create a new Organization.

## Step 2

Type in the account email address, display name, and unique name for your account. As the name implies, Pollination supports duplicate display names, but unique names must be - unique! If the name you chose is already taken, the entry field will alert you to choose a different name. You can either enter the URL of an image you would like to use as an avatar, or upload your own image after creating your organization. Click on _Create Organization_ to continue.

{% hint style="info" %}
An organization does not have additional seats or cloud resources by default. Learn more about [purchasing CAD plugin licenses](../../get-started/setting-up-rhino-grasshopper-and-revit-plugins/purchase-and-manage-plugins.md) and [managing the Licenses](../../get-started/manage-license-pool.md). You can always [purchase additional seats](purchase-additional-seats.md) or [add computing resources](purchase-additional-compute-resources.md) to the organization.
