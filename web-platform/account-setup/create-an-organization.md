# Create an Organization

An organization account is the only account type that supports multiple users and the ability to create teams. An organization can be a company, an association, a joint venture, or any other entity.

## Start in the Subscription Tab

## Enter Organization Details

Type in the account email address, display name, and unique name for your account. As the name implies, Pollination supports duplicate display names, but unique names must be - unique! If the name you chose is already taken, the entry field will alert you to choose a different name. You can either enter the URL of an image you would like to use as an avatar, or upload your own image after creating your organization. Click on _Create Organization_ to continue.

An organization does not have additional seats or cloud resources by default. You can use this organization to manage license pools for Pollination CAD Plugins. [Learn more about managing CAD Plugin Licenses](../../get-started/manage-license-pool.md). You can always [purchase additional seats](./purchase-additional-seats.md) or [add computing resources](./purchase-additional-compute-resources.md) to the organization.
