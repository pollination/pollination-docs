  NOTE: Only owners of an organization can add new members and manage
  permissions. Once you add members to your organization, you still need to add
  members to projects or CAD license pools to give them access to the resources.

# Add a Member to Your Account

{% hint style="warning" %}
You can only add additional members to your organization after purchasing additional seats. See [this page](purchase-additional-seats.md) for more information about purchasing additional seats.

Here is the step by step process to add a Pollination account to your organization.

![How to add a member to your organization](../../.gitbook/assets/add\_team\_members.gif)

1. Go to the members tab under the organization page.
2. Click on `Add Member` button.
3. Use the search for members field to search for eligible members with Pollination accounts.
4. Select the role for the new member. A member can be an `Owner` a `Member` of the organization.
5. Click on `Add Member` again to add them to the organization.
6. Congrats! The member has been added to your organization. They can now access organization resources including computing resources and CAD licenses. If the new member is not an owner of the organization, you must give them access to the CAD licenses explicitly by [adding them to the license pool](../../get-started/manage-license-pool.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
A free Starter account is required for a member to be added to an organization.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
An organization must at least have one owner. We recommend to assign an additional owner to help you with managing the organization. A good practice is to keep everyone else as a member unless they must be an owner to manage the organization resources.
