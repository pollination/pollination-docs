# 2. Add Organization Seats

You need to add additional seats to your organization account before adding new members to the organization.

    If you have a discount code you may use it at this step and before finishing the purchase by clicking on the `+ Add discount` button.\\
6. Congrats! The seats are now added to your organization. The next step is to add new members to your organization.

{% hint style="info" %}
It is not possible to mix the plans. For instance, you cannot buy 5 individual seats and one 10-seat package together. However, you can purchase multiple quantities of the same package.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
The quantity will be multiplied by the number of seats available in each package. For example, if you purchase three 10-seat subscriptions you will have 3 \* 10 = 30 seats.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
We use Paddle for processing the payments. As a result, it might take a few seconds before the subscription shows up under your account. If you don't see the subscription under your account immediately, try to refresh the page and the card should be updated.
