5. Change the `Quantity` of the package if needed. Keep in mind that the quantity will be multiplied by the number of seats that are available in your package. For example, if you are buying a 10 seats subscription with the quantity of 3, you will have 3 * 10 = 30 seats.

We use Paddle for processing the payments. As a result, it might take a few seconds before the subscription shows up under your account. If you don't see the subscription under your account immediately try to refresh the page and the card should be updated.
