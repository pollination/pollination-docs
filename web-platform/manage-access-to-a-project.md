# Manage Access to a Project

{% hint style="info" %}
Managing access to a project is only available for projects under an Organization.
{% endhint %}

After creating a project, you can manage access to a project from the "Collaborators" tab. Pollination manages all the access to a project by using teams.

{% hint style="warning" %}
It is required to [create a team](account-setup/create-teams.md) first before being able to add them to the project.
{% endhint %}

A team can have Read, Write, or Admin access to a project.

* **Read access** grants the team members access to all the project files and studies but they can't manage files or run any studies in the project.&#x20;
* **Write access** grants the team members to upload new files or delete existing files from the project. It will also allow them to manage the recipes, and create new studies. They will not be able to change the settings of the project or add/remove project collaborators.
* **Admin access** grants full access to the project including but not limited to deleting the project. The good practice is to limit the number of users who have admin access to the project.
