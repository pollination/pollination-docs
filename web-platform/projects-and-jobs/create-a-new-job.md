# Create a New Study

{% hint style="info" %}
You can only create a study under the projects you have been granted write access to.
{% endhint %}

## Step 1

[Create a new project](create-a-new-project.md) or select an existing project. Then click on the Studies tab.

### Step 2

Before running a new study, you must add the corresponding recipe to the project. See the next step, if the recipe is already added to the project.

If you don't see the recipe under the New Study section use the Add/Remove Recipes button to add new recipes. You can search for the recipes by name, and add them to the project. Each project can have as many recipes as needed.

## Step 3

Click on the recipe icon to select the recipe. It will expand the recipe, and show all the recipe inputs. Each recipe can have from 1 to many recipe inputs.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
You are only required to provide the Required Inputs to create a new study but it is good practice to also check all the Optional Inputs and ensure the default values are set correctly for your study.
{% endhint %}

## Step 4

Select all the inputs, and click on the <mark style="background-color:blue;">Create Study</mark> button. There are two options for assigning the file inputs. You can either upload the files or use the existing files in the project.
