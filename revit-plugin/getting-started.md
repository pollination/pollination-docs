# Before You Begin: Is the Pollination Revit Plugin Right for You?

The Pollination Revit plugin is a practical solution. It is built upon our years of experience in exporting hundreds of real-world Revit models. It took us many iteration to develop a solution that balances the level of automation and user control in the process.

Our guiding principle has been not to simplify the inherent complexities, and never claim to offer a magic bullet. Instead, we've developed a pragmatic product designed to help you generate a valid energy model even from imperfect real-world Revit files. Our commitment is to assist you in exporting your models from Revit, provided you approach the process with realistic expectations.

Let's start by clarifying three key facts about using Revit models for energy modeling:

1. **Revit models&#x20;**_**always**_**&#x20;require some cleanup before being exported as energy models.** While you may have heard otherwise, in some marketing campaigns, our extensive experience with real-world projects shows this is consistently the case. Accepting this reality is the first step.
2. **Revit models are prepared for documentation, not simulation.** This fundamental purpose isn't likely to change, regardless of our personal preferences.
3. **Despite imperfections, Revit models contain valuable data for energy models.** Overlooking this fact could lead to significant rework, as demonstrated by the common need to trace over PDFs when manual methods fail.

These points mean that every export process necessitates a minimum amount of work to accurately extract valuable information from Revit. The Pollination plugin empowers you to visualize, edit, and validate this information efficiently with many automated commands. Once you achieve a valid Pollination model, [we guarantee an accurate export to all supported simulation software](https://www.pollination.solutions/pact).

**If this perspective on Revit models and energy modeling matches yours, then Pollination is designed to help you succeed; otherwise, you may want to look somewhere else.**

## Can I get a demo of the Revit plugin?

Yes. We have already recorded two separate demos for you that shows the process. There is also a longer hands on video tutorial that walks you through every step of the process.

### 15-minute Demo

Here is a short 15-minute demo that shows the full process of the Revit plugin workflow.

### 40-minute Demo

Here is a longer version of the demo that shows the same process but with more details in each step.

### Hands on Tutorial

If you're interested to more than just a demo, you should [check out the full hands on tutorial](hands-on-tutorial/). It is developed based on many workshops that we have taught during the last several years and walks you through every step of the process using the Revit advance sample model.

### Revit plugin v3.0 Demo

One more thing! We're currently in the process of developing a brand new version of the Revit plugin to:

1. Improve the overall performance
2. Streamline the overall process
3. Add the ability to load construction and spaces types from Revit

The v3.0 is not currently available publicly but should be available at some point in 2026. Here is a demo of the latest version of the Revit plugin v3.0.
