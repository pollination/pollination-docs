# Before You Begin: Is the Pollination Revit Plugin Right for You?

We want to ensure the Pollination Revit plugin meets your expectations and workflow needs. This plugin is an ambitious yet practical solution, built upon years of experience in exporting hundreds of real-world Revit models.

We don't simplify the inherent complexities, nor do we claim to offer a magic bullet. Instead, we've developed a pragmatic product designed to help you generate a valid energy model even from imperfect real-world Revit files. Our commitment is to assist you in exporting your models from Revit, provided you approach the process with realistic expectations.

Let's start by clarifying three key facts about using Revit models for energy modeling:

1. **Revit models&#x20;**_**always**_**&#x20;require some cleanup before being exported as energy models.** While you may have heard otherwise, our extensive experience with real-world projects shows this is consistently the case. Accepting this reality is the first step.
2. **Revit models are prepared for documentation, not direct simulation.** This fundamental purpose isn't likely to change, regardless of personal preference.
3. **Despite imperfections, Revit models contain valuable data for energy models.** Overlooking this fact could lead to significant rework, as demonstrated by the common need to trace over PDFs when manual methods fail.

These points mean that every export process necessitates a minimum amount of work to accurately extract valuable information from Revit. The Pollination plugin empowers you to visualize, edit, and validate this information efficiently. Once you achieve a valid Pollination model, we guarantee an accurate export to all [supported simulation software](https://www.pollination.solutions/pact).

If this perspective on Revit models and energy modeling matches yours, then Pollination is designed to help you succeed; otherwise, you may want to look somewhere else.
