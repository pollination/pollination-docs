# Upcoming Improvements

The room, area, and space export process is functional and reliable, but the user experience needs enhancement.

The main limitation of the current workflow is the disconnect between the Pollination Snapshot and the Revit model. Once the snapshot is created, you can no longer update one of the rooms without going through the whole process for that room. This needs to change to provide a more interactive and iterative process.

Also, as we mentioned in the upcoming changes for selecting windows and doors, the process will be much intuitive if the user exports the Pollination rooms first, and then starts adding the windows to the existing rooms. The current approach, although functional, is somewhat backwards.

[Let us know](https://discourse.pollination.solutions/c/revit-plugin) if there is anything else that you would like to improve about the process for exporting rooms. Thank you!
