# Upcoming Improvements

We know that selecting family types from a table is not the most intuitive approach. As part of refactoring the Revit plugin user interface, we are working on a workflow that uses a Revit 3D view to select the window and door families.

To enhance intuitiveness and flexibility, we are testing a revised export process. This new order involves exporting rooms first, allowing users to then add windows and doors, a change from the current window-first, then room export.

[Let us know](https://discourse.pollination.solutions/c/revit-plugin) if there is anything else that you would like to improve about the process for exporting windows and doors. Thank you!
