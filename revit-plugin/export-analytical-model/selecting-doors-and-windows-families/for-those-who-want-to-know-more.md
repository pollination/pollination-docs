## Filtering families by levels

In some large models, you may benefit from filtering the window family to only show the ones that are located on the level that you're interested in exporting. The option is at the bottom of the menu. All the levels are selected by default.

## Exporting the preview as HTML or HBJSON

There is an option to export the preview as an HTML or an HBJSON file. You can use the HTML file to inspect different family types and geometries, and the HBSJON file to import the apertures to the Pollination Rhino plugin or Ladybug Tools.
