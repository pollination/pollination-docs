# Selecting Door Family Types

The process of selecting doors is the same as the one for windows, with two minor differences

* This is an "Is Glass" property for doors. This option allows you to export the doors that are mostly glass as windows.
* The "Multi Panel" option is not included in the "Panel Calculation" options. In the case of doors, we keep the options simple to a single panel or a bounding box.

For this tutorial, we will only select the Curtain Wall doors for export and set them to be modeled as glass doors (technically windows).

## Confirming your selection

Once you have reviewed the windows and doors, press OK to confirm your selection. It is time to move to the next step for creating rooms.

If you don't save the Revit model, this selection will only be available in the current session, and you'll have to reselect the windows and doors later.
