# Cleaning Up and Exporting the Snapshots

Once you have the snapshots, you can use the [Pollination Model Editor](broken-reference) to clean them up quickly and export them to any of the [supported file formats](../../../model-editor/supported-file-formats/export.md).

To open the Model Editor, click the "Export Model" button.

You should see the 3 snapshots for the levels and the snapshot for shades on the right side. For the rest of this tutorial, we will use the Pollination Model Editor to export the Snapshots as an energy model.

For this specific model, we will merge the snapshots before starting the clean-up, but for larger models with more levels, you may want to clean up the snapshots for each level first, before combining them into a single snapshot.

## Understanding a Typical Editing Process

The process for editing models can vary on a model-by-model basis. But in most cases, it includes 5 typical steps:

1. Fix visible misalignments and gaps
2. Fill holes with rooms, and merge smaller rooms
3. Check for small misalignments and gaps
4. Ensure model validation
5. Edit slanted and extended roofs

In this section of the tutorial, we will go through these steps to clean the Revit sample model.&#x20;

## For Those Who Want to Know More

You can read more about each step of a typical clean-up process [on this page](../../../model-editor/typical-editing-process-breakdown.md). There are also other optional steps that you might want to take to increase the quality of your model:

* [Converting roof extensions to shades](../../../model-editor/workflows/editing-roofs.md)
* [Merging rooms](../../../model-editor/workflows/merging-rooms-with-similar-programs.md) and [simplifying windows](../../../model-editor/workflows/simplifying-windows.md)
* [Renaming rooms](../../../model-editor/workflows/renaming-rooms.md)
* [Adjusting floor plan boundaries based on external wall thickness](../../../model-editor/workflows/adjusting-floor-plans-for-exterior-wall-thickness.md)
