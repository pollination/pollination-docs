# Ensuring Model Validation

One last step before exporting the model is to ensure the model is valid. If you have followed the previous steps, you should have already resolved most of the validation errors related to the floor plans.&#x20;

The most common validation issues that you might see at this point are related to the overlapping windows and doors. We will use the [Repair Windows](../../../model-editor/commands/me_repair_windows.md) command to fix those validation issues.
