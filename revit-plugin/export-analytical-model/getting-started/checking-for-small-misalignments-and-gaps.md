This section is a work in progress and currently doesn't include videos. If you prefer learning by watching videos, [see this page](../../../model-editor/getting-started.md).

After finding and fixing all the visible issues, it is time to inspect the model for invisible issues that we might have missed. The Model Editor provides a collection of commands and utilities to help with this process:

* ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/find-adjacency-gaps.svg)[Find Adjacency Gaps](../../../model-editor/commands/me_find_adjacency_gaps.md)
* Highlight Non-orthogonal Walls (Alt + O)
* ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/solve-adjacency (1).svg>) [Solve Adjacency](../../../model-editor/commands/me_solve_adjacency.md)
* Highlight External Walls (Alt + E)
