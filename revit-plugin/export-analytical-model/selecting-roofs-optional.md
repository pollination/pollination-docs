# Selecting Roofs (optional)

To start selecting roofs click on the Select Roofs button.This is an optional step to remove the unnecessary roofs to be exported to snapshots. In most cases, you would only need to export the slanted roofs. By default, all the roofs are selected to be exported.

The button opens up a menu that allows you to select the roof families that should be included in the Pollination model. Like the "Select Doors & Windows" menu, you can visualize the shades in the UI before exporting them.
