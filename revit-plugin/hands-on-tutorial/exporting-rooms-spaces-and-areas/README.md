# Exporting Rooms, Spaces, and Areas

Once you select the windows and doors families, it is time to export the rooms, spaces, or areas as Pollination rooms.

In this tutorial, we will use rooms as the geometry source, but the workflow will be the same for exporting Revit spaces or areas.
{% endhint %}

To start exporting Revit rooms, spaces, or areas as a Pollination snapshot, click on the `Export Rooms` button.
