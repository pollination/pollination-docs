# Hands on Tutorial: Exporting Revit Advanced Sample Model

{% hint style="info" %}
[Before starting this tutorial, you may want to ensure the Pollination Revit plugin is the right tool for you](../getting-started.md).
{% endhint %}

In this tutorial, we cover the process for exporting the Revit Advanced sample model as an energy model. By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to:

1. Understand the overall workflow for exporting energy models from Revit
2. Identify the most common issues in Revit models when exporting them as energy models
3. Understand and apply best practices to address those issues in the Model Editor
4. Determine when to address issues inside Revit versus the Model Editor

To get the most out of this tutorial, please follow the steps sequentially, as we'll be building upon concepts introduced earlier.

## Getting Started Checklist <a href="#getting-started-checklist" id="getting-started-checklist"></a>

Here is a short checklist before getting started with this tutorial:

1. If you haven't already installed the Revit plugin, you need to [download](../../get-started/setting-up-rhino-grasshopper-and-revit-plugins/download-plugins.md) and [install the plugin](../../get-started/setting-up-rhino-grasshopper-and-revit-plugins/download-and-install-plugins.md) on your computer.
2. You need to [purchase a license](../../get-started/setting-up-rhino-grasshopper-and-revit-plugins/purchase-and-manage-plugins.md) if you have already used the 14-day trial period. See [this page](../core-concepts-and-best-practices/managing-pollination-revit-license.md) for managing the Pollination Revit license.
3. If you will be using a license from a Pollination organization, ensure you have been added to the correct license pool. See [this page](../../get-started/manage-license-pool.md) for more information.
4. We will use the Revit Advanced Sample model for this tutorial. If you don't have the sample model, you can download it from [this page](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sUdlhcai6RS7IMr-_WjC1orQqesrm6lT?usp=sharing) for different versions of Revit.
