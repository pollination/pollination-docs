To start selecting roofs click on the Select Roofs button.This is an optional step to remove the unnecessary roofs from being exported to snapshots. In most cases, you would only need to export the slanted roofs. By default, all the roofs are selected to be exported.

The button opens up a menu that allows you to select the roof families that should be included in the Pollination model. Like the "Select Doors & Windows" menu, you can visualize the shades in the UI before exporting them.

### Top Face option

In some models it might make sense to use the top face in the roof geometry to make it easier to clean up the roof. Or sometimes you might want to have a geometry that looks the same as the architecture model. See this topic on Discourse.
