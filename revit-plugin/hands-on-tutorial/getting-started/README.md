# Exporting Model

Once you have the snapshots, you can use the Pollination Model Editor to clean them up quickly and export them to any of the [supported file formats](../../../model-editor/supported-file-formats/export.md). By the end of this section you will export the Revit Sample Model as a valid energy model to your platform of choice while learning how to use the Model Editor. At that point you can also add the Pollination Revit plugin to your resume! :)

To open the Model Editor, click the "Export Model" button.

For this specific model, we will merge the snapshots before starting the clean-up, but for larger models with more levels, you may want to clean up the snapshots for each level first, before combining them into a single snapshot.
