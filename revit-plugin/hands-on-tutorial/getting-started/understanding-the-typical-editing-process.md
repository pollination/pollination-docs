# Understanding the Typical Editing Process

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/s7eThPTlct0" %}

The process for editing models can vary on a model-by-model basis. But in most cases, it includes 5 typical steps:

1. Fix visible misalignment and gaps
2. Fill holes with rooms, and merge smaller rooms
3. Check for small misalignment and gaps
4. Ensure model validation
5. Edit slanted and extended roofs

In this section of the tutorial, we will go through these steps to clean the Revit sample model.

## For Those Who Want to Know More

You can read more about each step of a typical clean-up process [on this page](../../../model-editor/typical-editing-process-breakdown.md). There are also other optional steps that you might want to take to increase the quality of your model:

* [Converting roof extensions to shades](../../../model-editor/workflows/editing-roofs.md)
* [Merging rooms](../../../model-editor/workflows/merging-rooms-with-similar-programs.md) and [simplifying windows](../../../model-editor/workflows/simplifying-windows.md)
* [Renaming rooms](../../../model-editor/workflows/renaming-rooms.md)
* [Adjusting floor plan boundaries based on external wall thickness](../../../model-editor/workflows/adjusting-floor-plans-for-exterior-wall-thickness.md)
