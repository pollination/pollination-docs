# Selecting Door Family Types

The process of selecting doors is the same as the one for windows, with two minor differences

* This is an "Is Glass" property for doors. This option allows you to export the doors that are mostly glass as windows.
* The "Multi Panel" option is not included in the "Panel Calculation" options. In the case of doors, we keep the options simple to a single panel or a bounding box.

For this tutorial, we export the curtain wall doors as glass doors (technically windows).

## Confirming your selection

Once you have reviewed the windows and doors, press OK to confirm your selection. It is time to move to the next step for creating rooms.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you don't save the Revit model, this selection will only be available in the current session, and you'll have to reselect the windows and doors later.
{% endhint %}
