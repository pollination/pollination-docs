# An Alternative Workflow for Exporting Doors, Windows, and Roofs

If you have seen [the upcoming version of the Revit plugin (AKA Revit plugin v3.0)](../../stay-tuned-revit-plugin-v3.0.md) you might have noticed that among other changes we have changed the order in which we select and export different elements. We realized that it is usually much more straightforward to export the rooms first, clean them up, and then add roofs, windows, and doors. This video shows how you could achieve the same in the current version of the Revit plugin.

If you would like to follow along this video, and you don't want to go through the exporting process from Revit, here are the files:
