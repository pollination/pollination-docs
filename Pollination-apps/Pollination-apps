# Pollination Apps

A Pollination app is a way to capture a workflow in a web application.
Examples of these workflows are customized weather data visualization,
running simulations on models prepared in a CAD environment, post-processing
the results of a simulation, and visualizing the results back into the CAD environment.
[These](https://pollination.gallery/) are some of the early examples of the apps that
give an idea about what's possible with the apps.

### What are the prerequisite to develop a Pollination app?

1. you need to have a Pollination account. If you don't have one, you can create one for
   free by following the steps [here](../get-started/create-a-pollination-account.md).
2. You need to know enough python to work with
   [Ladybug tools API](https://discourse.ladybug.tools/pub/ladybug-tools-core-sdk-documentation)
   and [Streamlit API](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference).

### How to start developing a Pollination app?

We have several public [examples](https://github.com/pollination-apps) of apps deployed
on Pollination. Make sure to look at
these examples to get an idea of how to put together an app. Next, you will see guides for
several of the common workflows used in most of the apps.
