# Pollination Application Programming Interface (API)

You can use the Pollination public Application Programming Interface (API) to interact with the Pollination server from inside your apps or scripts.

You can interact with the API directly using our [OpenAPI client](https://api.pollination.cloud/docs) or read the documentation for each endpoint [here](https://api.pollination.cloud/redoc).

If you prefer using SDKs instead of interacting with the endpoints directly, we also generate and maintain several SDKs from the OpenAPI specification.

* [Pollination Javascript SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pollination-solutions/pollination-sdk)
* [Pollination C# SDK](https://www.nuget.org/packages/PollinationSDK)

This section includes some sample codes for getting you started. If you can't find what you need, feel free to open a requests for more sample code on [Pollination Discourse](https://discourse.pollination.cloud/c/scripting/11).
