Explode a polyline into several line segments.

## ![](../../.gitbook/assets/offset.svg#thumbnail) Offset

Offset the selected lines and/or polylines by a specified distance.

<details>

<summary>Options</summary>

**Offset Distance**

  The distance that the selected line/polyline will be offset. This can be either positive or negative and positive values will be interpreted as offsetting outwards or 'to the right' while negative numbers will be offset inwards or to 'to the left'

**Perimeter Polygons**

  Select to have the output be a series of closed perimeter polygons instead of a single offset line or polyline. Perimeter polygons can be used to split rooms into core and perimeter

</details>

The `Offset Distance` can be either positive or negative and positive values will be interpreted as offsetting outwards or "to the right" while negative numbers will be offset inwards or "to the left". The `Perimeter Polygons` option can be used to generate polygons from the offset, which can split rooms into core/perimeter.
