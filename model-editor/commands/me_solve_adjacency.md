# ![](../../.gitbook/assets/solve-adjacency.svg) Solve adjacency

Solve adjacency between selected rooms by assigning interior boundary conditions where rooms touch one another

## Options

* **Ceiling Adjacencies**

  Select to have the adjacency between the stories solved

## Details

You can optionally turn off the `Ceiling Adjacency` if you are planing to export to a platform with it's own adjacency-solving routine (eg. IES-VE) or you are primarily interested in simulating each Story as a distinct unit with adiabatic floors and ceilings. This command will only be visible when more than one room is selected.
