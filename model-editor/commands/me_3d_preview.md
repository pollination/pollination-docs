# ![](../../.gitbook/assets/3d-preview.svg#thumbnail) 3D preview

Show the selected rooms and shades in 3D. The preview shows up in a new floating window.

## Options

* **Ceiling Adjacencies**

  Select to have the adjacency between the stories solved

* **Exclude Plenums**

  Select to have ceiling and floor plenum depths ignored. This results in each room in the table translating to a single room in 3D instead of a base room with plenums split off of it
