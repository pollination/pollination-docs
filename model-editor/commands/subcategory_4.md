## <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/unite-square-duotone.svg" width="30" height="30"> Create boundary

Create polyline boundaries around a selection of rooms. The command can return polylines for either the exterior border around the rooms or just the holes (or both).

<summary>Options</summary>

**Mode**

  The calculation mode for creating boundaries. The options are Include Holes, Exclude Holes , and Holes Only

**Merge Distance**

  The maximum distance between rooms below which the boundary will be drawn around the rooms together (instead of being separate for each room). Setting a non-zero value here will allow you to draw boundaries around rooms that have gaps in between them (crossing gaps up to the specified distance)

You can use the generated borders for aligning the existing rooms or creating new rooms. See the line commands for the full list of the available commands.

<summary>Options</summary>

**Distance**

  The distance with which room vertices will be aligned to common axes. This dictates the resolution with which common axes will be generated
