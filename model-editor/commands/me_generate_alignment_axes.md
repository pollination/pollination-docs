<img src="images/gen-align-axes.svg" width="50" height="50"> 

Generate suggested alignment axes for rooms using a selected line to specify the alignment direction. All generated axes will be parallel to the selected line and will fall along the common axes of the selected rooms.

## Options

* **Distance**

  The distance with which room vertices will be aligned to common axes. This dictates the resolution with which common axes will be generated

* **All Common Axes**

  Select to have this command output all common axes of the rooms regardless of whether the rooms are already aligned to the axes. By default, only common axes to which the rooms are not already aligned are output
