# ![](../../.gitbook/assets/int-roof.svg) Find roof intersection

Find the intersection between two or more roof geometries in 3D space and draw a line (or polyline) in the scene where this intersection exists. Intersection lines will only be drawn on the first roof geometry of the selection and no result will be returned when the intersection of roof planes lies outside the boundary of the first face of the selection. So it may be necessary to adjust the order of the selection if the desired result is not obtained.
