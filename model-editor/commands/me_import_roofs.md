# ![](../../.gitbook/assets/import-roofs.svg#thumbnail) Import roofs

Import roofs from a HBJSON file. Import roofs translates all the orphaned shades in the HBJSON file to roof elements.

## Options

* **Replace Current Roofs**

  Select to have all of the roofs currently within the model replaced by the new roof geometries in the imported HBJSON file. If deselected, the roofs will simply be added to the current roof geometries in the model.
