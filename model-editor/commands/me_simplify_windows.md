# Simplify windows

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/simplify-windows (1).svg>)

Simplify and reduce the number of windows and/or skylights while maintaining the overall exterior window/skylight area. Useful for improving simulation speed without significantly changing energy use results.

## Options

*   **Merge Distance**

    The maximum distance between windows at which point they will be merged together into a single simpler window
*   **Single Window**

    Select to have the windows simplified to a single window within the center of each wall, which matches the overall area of the original windows
*   **Delete Doors**

    Select to have all doors removed from the rooms, which often have a small impact on overall building energy use
*   **Delete Interior**

    Select to have the interior windows and doors removed from the rooms, which often have a negligible impact on overall building energy use
*   **Ignore Skylights**

    Select to have all skylights left exactly as they are during the operation
*   **Ignore Windows**

    Select to have all windows left exactly as they are during the operation

## Details

Note that this command is not intended to fix invalid or un-simulate-able windows and the "Repair windows" command should be used for these purposes.
