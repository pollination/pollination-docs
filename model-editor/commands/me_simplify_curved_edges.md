# Simplify Curved Edges

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/simplify-curved-room (1).svg>)

Simplify and reduce the number of vertices defining curved edges of rooms.

## Options

*   **Deviation Distance**

    The distance that a curved part of the room is allowed to differ from a straight line. Lower tolerance values correspond to a higher resolution of curvature with more vertices
