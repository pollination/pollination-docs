<img src="images/unite-square-duotone.svg" width="50" height="50"> 

Create polyline boundaries around a selection of rooms. The command can return polylines for either the exterior border around the rooms or just the holes (or both).

## Options

* **Mode**

  The calculation mode for creating boundaries. The options are Include Holes, Exclude Holes , and Holes Only

* **Merge Distance**

  The maximum distance between rooms below which the boundary will be drawn around the rooms together (instead of being separate for each room). Setting a non-zero value here will allow you to draw boundaries around rooms that have gaps in between them (crossing gaps up to the specified distance)

## Details

You can use the generated borders for aligning the existing rooms or creating new rooms. See the line commands for the full list of the available commands.
