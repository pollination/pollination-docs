# Split

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/split-room (1).svg>)

Split rooms or roofs by the selected lines/polylines.

## Options

*   **Gap Distance**

    An optional distance value to introduce a gap along the line/polyline that is splitting. This should almost always be zero except when using this command to work around eQuest's lack of support for courtyard buildings. In this case, the gap distance can be used to create a gap that connects the building exterior to the courtyard.
