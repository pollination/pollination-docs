# Rectangularize windows

![](../../.gitbook/assets/rectangularize-windows.svg)

Convert windows and/or skylights to rectangles. Useful for cleaning Revit-exported window families that are supposed to be rectangular.

## Options

*   **Max Area Change Percent**

    A number for the maximum percent change in area that is allowed by the operation. For example, setting this to 100 will allow windows to double in size (instead of leaving them un-rectangularized). Set to a negative number to have all windows rectangularized no matter the change in area
*   **Ignore Skylights**

    Select to have all skylights left as they are during the rectangularize operation
*   **Ignore Windows**

    Select to have all windows left as they are during the rectangularize operation
