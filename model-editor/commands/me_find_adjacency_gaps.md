# <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/find-adjacency-gaps.svg" width="50" height="50"> Find adjacency gaps

Identify gaps smaller than a specified gap distance. Such gaps typically do not make the model invalid or un-simulate-able but they can create cases where adjacency solving fails to set interior boundary conditions where they likely should be. Small gaps can also result in sliver geometries for floors/ceilings in the case the ceiling adjacencies are solved.

## Options

* **Gap Distance**

  The maximum distance between two rooms that is considered an unwanted adjacency gap. Differences between rooms that are higher than this distance are considered meaningful separations between rooms that should be preserved. Typical recommended values might be around 15 cm or 6''.
