# What is Pollination Model Editor

Model Editor is the outcome of cleaning up hundreds of Revit models using the Pollination Revit plugin. The Model Editor helps you automatically find and fix all the common issues in energy model geometries. If there is a common issue with the Revit model, [we have a workflow for you to fix it](workflows.md)! Most of the fixes involve just a few clicks.

Moreover, unlike the other tools in the market, Pollination's wide array of supported file formats makes it the interoperability tool of choice for creating building performance simulation geometries. Most tools lock you into one or two proprietary formats, but Pollination is set to change this once and for all. When you have a valid model in any Pollination interface, including the Model Editor, you can export it to your favorite building performance simulation software including but not limited to IES VE, eQuest, OpenStudio, EnergyPlus, Ladybug Tools Honeybee, and IDA ICE.

See the [supported file formats](supported-file-formats/) section for the full list of import and export possibilities.

## The embedded version vs the web-based version

The Model Editor is available as an embedded application inside the Pollination Revit plugin and a standalone web application hosted at https://editor.pollination.solutions.

The web-based edition of the Model Editor is only meant to be used for testing the Model Editor and practice using the sample models.

Use the Model Editor from Revit to access the full functionalities.

## Model Editor UI

The screenshot below shows the different sections of the model editor. When the model editor is accessed from inside the Revit plugin you will see a `Snapshots` button in the bottom left corner. Click on the button to open the snapshot manager that shows all the available snapshots.
