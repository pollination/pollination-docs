# Filling Holes with Rooms

You can add the missing rooms in two steps:

1. Select the rooms around the missing rooms.
2. Use the [Fill Holes](../commands/#fill-holes) command to place a room in the missing areas. The command allows you to set the basename for the newly created rooms. It also allows you to set an area threshold for merging the small rooms with the larger adjacent rooms automatically.

Keep in mind that the hole area should be fully bounded. You might need to use the [Pull to Room](../commands/#pull-to-room) or [Align](../commands/#align) command to clean the rooms around the hole, ensuring the hole is fully bound before adding a new room.
