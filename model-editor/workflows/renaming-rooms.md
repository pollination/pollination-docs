# Renaming Rooms

Editing the names of the rooms based on different room properties has been one of the most common requests for the Model Editor. Use the Python script editor to rename all the rooms or a selection of the rooms based on the different room properties. See [this example](../python-script-editor/your-first-python-script.md#rename-the-rooms) for getting started.

See this example for a more advanced option that uses the room program type for renaming the rooms.
