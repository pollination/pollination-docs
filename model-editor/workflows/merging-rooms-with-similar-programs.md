# Merging Rooms with Similar Programs

It is common for energy modelers to simplify the architectural models before exporting them as an energy model. We currently support merging several rooms together into a single room or simplifying several windows into one or multiple windows.

### Merge rooms

You can merge several rooms into a single room by selecting the rooms and using the [Merge Rooms](../commands/#merge-rooms) command. The command also provides options for simplifying the walls or the windows as part of the merge process.
