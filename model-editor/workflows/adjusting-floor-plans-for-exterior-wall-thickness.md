# Adjusting Floor Plans for Exterior Wall Thickness

Some modeling codes are very specific about how the boundary of the room should be located for external versus internal walls. By default, Revit locates the boundary lines in the middle of the walls for both interior and exterior walls. You can use a combination of [Create Boundary](../commands/#create-boundary), [Offset](../commands/#offset), and [Align](../commands/#align) commands to adjust the floor boundary to match the outside of the exterior walls.
