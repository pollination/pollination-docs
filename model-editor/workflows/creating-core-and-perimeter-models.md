# Creating Core and Perimeter Models

Model Editor provides the necessary functionalities to easily and quickly build core and perimeter models from your Pollination models. In most cases, the process has three steps:

1. Merging the rooms. If the model is not clean, you may need to use a large tolerance value.
2. Cleaning up the boundary. You want to ensure the edges of the room don't have small setbacks or segments to avoid creating several small perimeter zones.
3. Use the [Split Core and Perimeter](../commands/me_split_core_and_perimeter.md) command to create a core and perimeter model.
