# Validating Models

You can use the [Validate Model](../commands/#validate-model) command to ensure your model meets all the validation requirements. In case the model is invalid, you can use several Model Editor commands including the alignment commands, and the [Repair Windows](../commands/#repair-windows) command to validate the model.
