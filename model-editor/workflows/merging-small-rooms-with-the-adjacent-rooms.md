# Merging Small Rooms with the Adjacent Rooms

In many models of hospital or lab buildings, you will have several small rooms in the model for risers, etc. The [Merge Small Rooms](../commands/me_merge_small_rooms.md) command merges small rooms into the larger adjacent rooms. If there are several adjacent rooms, the rooms are always merged into the adjacent large room with which they share the most perimeter.
