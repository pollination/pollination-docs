# Stay Tuned: Revit Plugin v3.0

The current version of the Revit plugin works as promised! It has been used to successfully export projects of all different sizes with varying levels of complexity in a fraction of the time it would have taken otherwise. We are so confident in the quality of the exports that we have a pact to refund your money if you face issues exporting a valid model. That said, we have also been clear that the overall workflow of the plugin can be significantly improved. That's why, when we reached a good stopping point with both the functionalities and the performance of the current version of the Revit plugin, we started developing v3.0.

The main goals of undertaking another major refactor and development go beyond improving the plugin's performance. The new version is more integrated and easier to use. It also provides stronger two-way interoperability with Revit, enabling you to send and receive data to/from Revit at any point during the process. There is no need to save every level to a file and open it in the Model Editor. You simply load the data from Revit into the Model Editor directly.

If you would like to know more and understand how it works, here is a short demo of the latest version of the Revit Plugin v3.0.
