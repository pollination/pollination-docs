### 4.4 Compliance with Laws

You will ensure that your instructions comply with all laws, regulations, and rules applicable in relation to Your Controlled Data and that Your Controlled Data is collected lawfully by you or on your behalf and provided to us by you in accordance with such laws, rules, and regulations. You will also ensure that the processing of Your Controlled Data in accordance with your instructions will not cause or result in us or you breaching any laws, rules, or regulations.

## 5. Our Processing Responsibilities

### 5.1 How We Process

We warrant that we will process Your Controlled Data for the Purpose, only, and in accordance with requirements of the GDPR including without limitations its Article 28 and Article 32, respectively, the the Agreement or instructions you give us through your Account. Additional instructions outside the scope of this Data Processing Addendum require a prior written agreement between you and us, including the agreement on any additional fees payable by you to us for carrying out such instructions.

### 5.2 Data Transfer

If personal data processed under this Agreement is transferred from a country within the European Economic Area to a country outside the European Economic Area, the parties shall ensure that the personal data are adequately protected. To achieve this, the parties shall, unless agreed otherwise, rely on EU approved standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data.

### 5.3 Notification of Breach

We will provide you notice without undue delay after becoming aware of and confirming the occurrence of a Breach for which notification to you is required under applicable Data Protection Legislation. We will, to assist you in complying with your notification obligations under Articles 33 and 34 of the GDPR, provide you with such information about the Breach as we are reasonably able to disclose to you, taking into account the nature of the Services, the information available to us and any restrictions on disclosing the information such as for confidentiality. Our obligation to report or respond to a Breach under this Section is not and will not be construed as an acknowledgment by Pollination of any fault or liability of Pollination with respect to the Breach. Despite the foregoing, Pollination's obligations under this Section do not apply to incidents that are caused by you, any activity on your Account, and/or Third-Party Services.

### 5.4 Sub-Processors

1. We warrant that we will meet the requirements specified in Article 28(2) and (4) GDPR in order to engage another processor (a sub-processor).
2. We will therefore not engage another processor (sub-processor) for the fulfillment of the DPA without the prior\
   general written authorization of the data controller.
3. You give us the general authorization for the engagement of sub-processors. We shall inform you in writing of any intended changes concerning the addition or replacement of sub-processors at least thirty (30) days in advance, thereby giving you the opportunity to object to such changes prior to the engagement of the concerned sub-processor(s). The list of sub-processors already authorized by the data controller can be found in the [Subprocessors document](subprocessors.md).
4. Where we engage a sub-processor for carrying out specific processing activities on behalf of you, the same data protection obligations as set out in the DPA shall be imposed on that sub-processor by way of a contract or other legal act under EU or Member State law, in particular providing sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures in such a manner that the processing will meet the requirements of the DPA and the GDPR.
5. A copy of such a sub-processor agreement and subsequent amendments shall – at your request – be submitted to you, thereby giving the data controller the opportunity to ensure that the same data protection obligations as set out in the DPA are imposed on the sub-processor. DPA on business related content that do not affect the legal data protection content of the sub-processor agreement, shall not require submission to the data controller.
6. If the sub-processor does not fulfil his data protection obligations, we remain fully liable to you for the fulfillment of the obligations of the sub-processor. This does not affect the rights of the data subjects under the GDPR – in particular those foreseen in Articles 79 and 82 GDPR – against neither you nor us, including the sub-processor.

## 6. Liability

The liability of each party under this Data Processing Addendum is subject to the exclusions and limitations of liability set out in the Agreement. You agree that any regulatory penalties or claims by data subjects or others incurred by Pollination in relation to Your Controlled Data that arise as a result of, or in connection with, your failure to comply with your obligations under this Data Processing Addendum or Data Protection Legislation shall reduce Pollination's maximum aggregate liability to you under the Agreement in the same amount as the fine and/or liability incurred by us as a result.

## 7. Conflict

In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the provisions of the Agreement and this Addendum, the provisions of this Addendum shall prevail. For the avoidance of doubt and to the extent allowed by applicable law, any and all liability under this Addendum, including limitations thereof, will be governed by the relevant provisions of the Agreement. You acknowledge and agree that Pollination may amend this Addendum from time to time by posting the relevant amended and restated Addendum and such amendments to the Addendum are effective as of the date of posting. Your continued use of the Services after the amended Addendum is posted to Pollination's website constitutes your agreement to, and acceptance of, the amended Addendum. If you do not agree to any changes to the Addendum, do not continue to use the Service.

## 8. Miscellaneous
