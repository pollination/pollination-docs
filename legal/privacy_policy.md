## 2. What Information Pollination Does Not Collect

We do not intentionally collect sensitive personal information, such as social security numbers, genetic data, health information, or religious information. Although Pollination does not request or intentionally collect any sensitive personal information, we realize that you might store this kind of information in your account, such as in a project. You are responsible for complying with any regulatory controls regarding data you store on our servers.

We do not intentionally collect User Personal Information that is stored in your projects or any other free-form content inputs. Information in your projects belongs to you, and you are responsible for it, as well as for making sure that your content complies with our Terms of Service.

If your project has been published and is now public, anyone (including Pollination employees) may view its contents. Information you store in public projects may be indexed by search engines or used by third parties. In addition, while we do not generally search for content in your private projects, we may scan our servers for certain tokens or security signatures, or for known active malware.

## 3. How We Share the Information We Collect

We do share User Personal Information with your permission, so we can perform services you have requested or communicate on your behalf. For example, if you invite another Pollination User to a project, we will send them an email including your name and Pollination login, and a link to your suggested project. If you join an Organization or a Team, the other members of the organization may be able to view and edit any organization projects you create. We will respect your choices.

We do not share, sell, rent, or trade User Personal Information with third parties for their commercial purposes.

We do not host advertising on Pollination. We may occasionally embed content from third party sites, such as YouTube, and that content may include ads. Any advertisements on individual Pollination projects are not sponsored by, or tracked by, Pollination.

We do not disclose User Personal Information outside Pollination, except in the situations listed in this section or when compelled to by law.

We do share certain aggregated, non-personally identifying information with others about how our users, collectively, use Pollination. For example, we may compile statistics on the usage of open source libraries or public Recipes across Pollination. However, we do not sell this information to advertisers or marketers.

We may share User Personal Information with your permission, so we can perform services you have requested.

We may share User Personal Information with a limited number of third-party vendors who process it on our behalf to provide or improve our service, and who have agreed to privacy restrictions similar those in our Terms of Service. Our vendors may perform services such as payment processing, sending email on our behalf, content delivery networking, error log analysis, and other similar services.

We may share User Personal Information if we are involved in a merger, sale, or acquisition. If any such change of ownership happens, we will notify you on our website or by email before any transfer of your User Personal Information.

## 4. Public Information on Pollination

Much of Pollination is public-facing. If your content is public-facing, third parties may access and use it in compliance with our Terms of Service. We do not sell that content; it is yours. However, we do allow third parties, such as internet archives, to compile public-facing Pollination information.

Your Personal Information, associated with your content, may be gathered by third parties in these compilations of Pollination data. If you do not want your Personal Information to appear in third parties' compilations of Pollination data, please do not make your Personal Information publicly available.

## 5. Cookies

Pollination uses cookies (and similar technologies, such as HTML5 localStorage) to keep you logged in, remember your preferences, and provide information for future development of Pollination. The cookies Pollination sets are essential for the operation of the website or are used for performance or functionality. By using the Website, you agree that we can place these types of cookies on your computer or device. If you disable your browser or device's ability to accept cookies, you will not be able to log in or use the Service.

Certain pages on our site may set other third party cookies. For example, we may embed content, such as videos, from another site that sets a cookie. Or another user's project may embed a third party video. While we try to minimize these third party cookies, we can't always control what cookies this third party content sets.

## 6. Tracking and analytics

We use a number of third party analytics and service providers to help us evaluate our users' use of Pollination, compile statistical reports on activity, and improve our content and website performance. In addition, we use our own internal analytics software to provide features and improve our service and performance.

We do not permit third parties other than our analytics and service providers to track our users' activity over time on Pollination. We do not track your online browsing activity on other online services.
